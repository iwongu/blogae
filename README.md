blogae
======
Personal blogging platform for Google App Engine.


Description
-----------
This project is to run a blog of an admin and multiple authors in a GAE (Google App Engine) instance. A GAE instance has enough free quota to run a single blog in many cases. If yours uses more than the free quota, you can pay only for what you used. (Or pay nothing and wait for the daily quota refresh.)


Features
--------

 * A GAE instance is handling only one blog. So, the admin UI is very simple and clean.
 * Supports many list views. Yearly, monthly, tag, and search views.
 * Supports Atom feed.
 * Live preview in editor view.
 * Supports photo section from G+ photos (a.k.a. Picasa). And yes, you can select your non-public photos too. It requires some extra configuration in your GAE and blogae configs.


Installation
------------
See wiki.
